                              CLINICACT
        Clinical Action Layer - AI-Powered Clinical Documentation
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ClinicAct is an intelligent "sidecar" web application that revolutionizes 
clinical documentation and data entry in healthcare settings. Built as a Next.js
application, it sits alongside Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems to 
automate the tedious process of translating clinical conversations into 
structured medical orders and documentation.

The system acts as a smart assistant for healthcare providers, listening to 
patient consultations and automatically generating draft orders for medications, 
referrals, lab tests, and imaging studies - all ready for the doctor to review 
and approve with a single click.


CORE FUNCTIONALITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. TRANSCRIPT INGESTION
   - Accepts audio transcripts from patient consultations
   - Supports integration with transcription services
   - Processes both real-time and uploaded transcripts

2. AI-POWERED ANALYSIS
   - Uses advanced AI models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet / Gemini) to analyze clinical
     conversations
   - Extracts clinical intents and medical decisions from natural language
   - Identifies medications, referrals, tests, and procedures mentioned
   - Maps extracted information to standardized medical coding systems

3. FHIR RESOURCE GENERATION
   - Converts AI-extracted clinical intents into valid FHIR R4 resources
   - Generates draft orders including:
     * MedicationRequest - Prescription orders
     * ServiceRequest - Lab tests, imaging, procedures, referrals
     * QuestionnaireResponse - Structured clinical documentation
   - Ensures all data follows HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability 
     Resources) standards

4. INTERACTIVE REVIEW INTERFACE
   - Displays "Action Cards" for each proposed clinical action
   - Shows draft orders with all relevant details pre-filled
   - Allows physicians to review, edit, and approve orders
   - Provides contextual information and validation

5. PATIENT DATA INTEGRATION
   - Searches and retrieves patient demographics from Medplum FHIR server
   - Displays comprehensive patient information including:
     * Demographics (name, DOB, contact info)
     * Insurance information
     * Emergency contacts
     * Medical history
   - Ensures proper patient context for all orders

6. QUESTIONNAIRE WORKFLOW
   - Integrates with FHIR Questionnaires stored in Medplum
   - Maps AI-generated actions to appropriate questionnaire forms
   - Auto-fills questionnaire responses based on transcript analysis
   - Supports complex multi-field clinical forms

7. ORDER EXECUTION
   - Submits approved orders directly to Medplum FHIR server
   - Creates permanent medical records from draft orders
   - Maintains audit trail of all clinical actions
   - Ensures data integrity and compliance

8. AFTERCARE COMMUNICATION
   - Automatically generates patient-friendly aftercare summaries
   - Creates personalized emails explaining:
     * What was discussed during the visit
     * Prescribed medications and instructions
     * Scheduled tests and referrals
     * Next steps in care
   - Sends summaries via SendGrid email service
