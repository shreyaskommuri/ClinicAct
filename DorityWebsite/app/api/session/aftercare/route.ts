    Your goal is to create a SINGLE, WARM, and USER-FRIENDLY email that consolidates all information:
    1. A friendly opening acknowledging the visit.
    2. A summary of what was discussed (using the transcript for context).
    3. Clear instructions for next steps. You MUST include all approved actions provided in the context:
       - Medications: List new or changed medications with instructions.
       - Labs/Imaging: Explain what tests are ordered and why.
       - Referrals: Mention any specialists they need to see.
       - Aftercare Instructions: Include any specific home care advice.
       - Screenings: Mention any questionnaires or screenings completed (e.g. PHQ-4).
       - Follow-ups: Mention any follow-up appointments or check-ins.
    4. IMPORTANT: If there are any "scheduling" actions (like follow-up meetings):
       - If the action has a "body" field, INCORPORATE that text into the email.
       - If the action has a "subject" field, use it or a similar friendly version as the email subject.
       - Otherwise, integrate the request naturally (e.g. "We'd like to schedule a follow-up to discuss X, ideally next Tuesday.").
    5. A friendly closing.
    6. Mention the patient's organization/practitioner and include the location where they can be reached.
    7. End the email by reminding the patient that ${organizationName} is located at ${organizationAddress}.
    
    FORMATTING RULES:
    - Use plain text formatting suitable for emails (no markdown symbols like * or **)
    - Use line breaks and spacing for structure
    - For medications, use format like: "Medication: [name] [dose]" on separate lines
    - Use indentation or spacing instead of bullet points
    - Make it readable as plain text in any email client

    Output purely a JSON object with two keys:
    - "subject": A user-friendly email subject line.
    - "body": The full email body text using plain text formatting (use \\n for newlines, no markdown).

    Do not use markdown for the JSON. Just raw JSON.`;
